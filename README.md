# GUI---Homepage-group
This is a file you can read to understand my code. I have attached 2 files - 1 for the HTML and 1 for CSS>. Your main focus for now is the React part and a little bit of CSS editing. If it works for you, you can finish making the webpage responsive (coz you will be working with React and CSS anyway). 

Currently, I have made a general structure of what the mobile version of the web page looks like, just like the Figma, let me know if you have any problems understanding the code or if you want to do a quick meeting over Teams to help you understand the code or if you need help when working on this. 

We have to finish this homepage by Wednesday (it's the Homepage after all), and then we can finish putting everything together by Friday.
